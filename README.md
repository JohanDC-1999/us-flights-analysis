Exploratory Data Analysis and Explanatory Data Visualization performed on US Flights dataset.

## About the dataset
We will be using datasets which contain data about flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays. There are multiple year's worth of data, ranging from 1987 up to 2008. This dataset also contains many different variables/columns, we will need to explore these in order to make a decision on which ones we wish to keep. We will only work with year 2007 for this analysis since it has the most records between all the years.
